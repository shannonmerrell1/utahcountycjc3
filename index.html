      <p> Welcome to Children’s Justice Center. We protect children by allowing them to report physical and sexual abuse in privacy.</p>
      <p> At the Children’s Justice Center, trained professional law enforcement personnel and CPS social workers investigate cases of child sexual abuse and serious physical abuse.  This investigation includes a comprehensive child interview process (video and audio taped) and multidisciplinary staffing and tracking of the case. When necessary, child victims at the CJC undergo medical forensic exams, in consultation with Primary Children’s Medical Center Child Protection Team.  These exams take place in the medical unit within our facility.</p>
      <p> Additionally we provide mental health assessment and referrals to  community providers, as well as group therapy for children, victim and witness support services, crisis intervention for the child and family, and tracking of the case progress through the criminal justice system. Learn more about our services here.</p>

    <div class="faqs">
      <p>What are signs of Abuse?</p>
      <p>There isn’t one single sign that indicates sexual abuse, but the presence of several suggests you might ask questions or report . Sometimes a child will leave clues that seem to provoke discussion about sexual issues, or write or draw sexual or frightening images. A child may also mimic sexual behaviors with toys or hint at shared secrets with an adult.</p>
      <p> Why should I get involved? </p>
      <p> Child abuse frequently goes unreported because people who could help don’t want to become involved. Victims of child abuse face serious and lasting consequences. When you report, you offer a child treatment, support, counseling, legal protection. Report information; all children deserve the right to a safe environment. </p>
      <p> How do I know what to report? </p>
      <p> Report if you have a “reasonable suspicion” that a child has been or is in danger of abuse or neglect.  “Reasonable suspicion” means that most people, given the same facts and information, would suspect child abuse.  You do not need to have evidence to report,  but reports must be in good faith. Use common sense.</p>
      <p> How do I report? </p>
      <p> To report in Utah, call DCFS at 1-855-323-3237. You’ll provide a complete, honest account of your observations of potential maltreatment and a case worker will move forward with the information.  If your issue is not resolved, please visit dcfs.utah.gov/contact-us/ to follow up with a regional office. </p>
